Qestion 1

The network is still secure since it is encrypted through
an authentication by public key. Since the private key is not
available, the message can't be decrypted. A person can't get
the private key through the public. So it is still secure.

1)
It is not secure
Since the other teams had also tapped your keyboards and had
observed all of your team's keystrokes. They are able to access
the private key when it is authentication. The private key is
also revealed. So they can have access to private key to decrypt
all the data. So the connection is not secure.

2)
It is not secure.
Since he other teams temporarily had physical control of the USB. They
have the access to the system data files. In the ssh files, the public
and the private keys are revealed.

2
gpg --verify this command will chech whether the public key
and the signatures match or not. It is used to verify public
keys. If the file is transfered, the process can be interupt by
other users. The hacker can change the signatures and send it
as the original signature. This will decrypt files and cause
damage.

To fix this problem, it is useful to post public key or detached
signature file to the internet. The receiver can having the right
key to verify dealing with the file transfer issue.

using that CD to go into ubuntu system

choose the try ubuntu

$ sudo apt-get install openssh-server
$ sudo apt-get install openssh-client

Install all the required openSSH

client part
-----------------------------------------

$ ssh-keygen
To create the key

He gave me his server ip address 10.97.85.65

$ ping 10.97.85.65

$ ssh-copy-id -i client@10.97.85.65
click yes and add the key

I copied the public key to the server for key-based
authentication

$ ssh-add
add a private key to authentication agent

$ ssh client@10.97.85.65
$ ssh -X client@10.97.85.65

I run xterm on the server

Then I created a file
$ touch test.txt

The server checked on his computer
cd /home/client
ls

There is a file called test.txt

Server part
-----------------------------------------------
$ sudo apt-get install openssh-client

I already did ssh-keygen so I don't need
to do it again.

$ sudo useradd -d /home/apple -m apple
creat an account for the client on the server.

I set the client name to be apple

$ sudo passwd apple
Create a password and I set is to "password"
And I give it to my partener.

$ cd /home/apple
$ sudo mkdir .ssh

create .ssh directory for new user

$ sudo chown -R apple .ssh
$ sudo chown 700 .ssh

change ownership and permission on .ssh directory

$ hostname -I

I got my ip address
10.97.85.56

My partener created a file apple.txt on his computer

$ ls
I can see the apple.txt

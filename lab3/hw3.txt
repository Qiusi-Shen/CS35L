It is necessary. "goto case_long_iso_time_style;" will cause
we goto the long iso time style. After we delete this lane,
that command will run and will not cause that trouble.

Q3
wget http://web.cs.ucla.edu/classes/spring17/cs35L/assign/randline.py

python randline.py /dev/null
The display is following

Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "randline.py", line 70, in <module>
    main()
  File "randline.py", line 64, in main
    sys.stdout.write(generator.chooseline())
  File "randline.py", line 34, in chooseline
    return random.choice(self.lines)
  File "/usr/local/cs/Python-2.7.12/lib/python2.7/random.py",
  line 275, in choice
  return seq[int(self.random() * len(seq))]
  # raises IndexError if seq is empty
IndexError: list index out of range

Because the function random.choice will become undefined behavior
if the file is empty.

Q4
python3 randline.py

File "randline.py", line 65
    except IOError as (errno, strerror):
                      ^
SyntaxError: invalid syntax

Because the argument "except...as" cannot be a tuple.
